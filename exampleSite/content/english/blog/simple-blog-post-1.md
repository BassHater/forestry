# If Netguru not hunt you, then You hunt the Netguru!

Life is a difficult things. If you planned to work from home, life get you new additional option:

1. Forget about 500Mb/s fast internet. How to about 128kb/s non stable internet? Didn't give up?
2. Wish full-time 8 hour lessons and practice? Find time to learn Python after a 12 hour hard-work shift. Didn't give up?
3. May be you want to devote a whole day to learning and practice? It's again not for  you. Only 7/7, from Monday to Sunday.

   ## But it is always new challenges and... so romantic :

How about this?
